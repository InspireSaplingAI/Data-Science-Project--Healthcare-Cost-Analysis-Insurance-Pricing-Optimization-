    "2. **P-value**  \n",
    "   - Estimates the probability of observing such a difference by random chance alone  \n",

    "Cohen's d is a standardized measure of effect size that quantifies the difference between two group means in terms of their combined variability.

    "   The raw difference between average medical costs of smokers and non-smokers\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pooled Standard Deviation**  \n",
    "   A weighted average of both groups' variability that serves as the \"yardstick\" for standardization\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Final Calculation**  \n",
